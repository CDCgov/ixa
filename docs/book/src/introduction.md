# Introduction

Ixa (Interactive eXecution of ABMs) is a Rust framework for building modular
agent-based discrete event models for large-scale simulations. While its primary
application is modeling disease transmission, its flexible design makes it
suitable for a wide range of simulation scenarios.

Ixa is named after the
[Ixa crab](https://www.crabdatabase.info/en/crabs/brachyura/eubrachyura/heterotremata/leucosioidea/leucosiidae/ixa/ixa-cylindrus-5874),
a genus of Indo-Pacific pebble crabs from the family Leucosiidae.

You are reading The Ixa Book, a tutorial introduction to Ixa. API documentation
can be found at [https://ixa.rs/doc/ixa](https://ixa.rs/doc/ixa).

This book assumes you have a basic familiarity with the command line and at
least some experience with programming.
