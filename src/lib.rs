//! A framework for building discrete-event simulations
//!
//! Ixa is a framework designed to support the creation of large-scale
//! discrete event simulations. The primary use case is the construction of
//! agent-based models for disease transmission, but the approach is applicable
//! in a wide array of circumstances.
//!
//! The central object of an Eosim simulation is the `Context` that is
//! responsible for managing all the behavior of the simulation. All of the
//! simulation-specific logic is embedded in modules that rely on the `Context`
//! for core services such as:
//! * Maintaining a notion of time for the simulation
//! * Scheduling events to occur at some point in the future and executing them
//!   at that time
//! * Holding module-specific data so that the module and other modules can
//!   access it
//!
//! In practice, a simulation usually consists of a set of modules that work
//! together to provide all of the functions of the simulation. For instance,
//! For instance, a simple disease transmission model might consist of the
//! following modules:
//! * A population loader that initializes the set of people represented
//!   by the simulation.
//! * An infection seeder that introduces the pathogen into the population.
//! * A disease progression manager that transitions infected people through
//!   stages of disease until recovery.
//! * A transmission manager that models the process of an infected
//!   person trying to infect susceptible people in the population.
