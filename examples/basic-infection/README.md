# Infection model: constant force of infection
This example demonstrates a simple model which infects a homogeneous population
assuming a constant force of infection. In other words, all individuals have the same
characteristics, and infections are caused by something like a food-borne disease
 and not from interactions between individuals.

## Simulation overview

![Diagram of infection](infection-diagram.png)
![alt text](image.png)

The first infection attempt is scheduled at time 0. Infection attempts are scheduled to occur based on the constant force of infection. Once an infection event is scheduled, a susceptible individual is selected to be infected. After an infection attempt is finished, the next infection event is scheduled based on a constant force of infection. The simulation ends after no more infection events are scheduled.

Infected individuals schedule their recovery at time `t + infection_period`. The infection status of recovered individuals remains as recovered for the rest of the simulation.

The global model parameters are as follows:
* `population_size`: number of individuals to include in the simulation
* `foi`: force of infection, rate at which susceptible individuals become infected
* `infection_period`: time that an individual spends from infection to recovery

## Architecture
As in other `ixa` models, the simulation is managed by a central `Context` object
which loads parameters, initializes user-defined modules, and starts a callback
execution loop:

```rust
struct Parameters {
    random_seed: u64,
    population_size: usize,
    foi: f64,
    infection_period: u64
}

let context = Context::new();
context::load_parameters<Parameters>("config.toml")

// Initialize modules
context::add_module(population_manager);
context::add_module(transmission_manager);
context::add_module(infection_manager);
context::add_module(person_property_report);

// Run the simulation
context::execute();
```

Individuals transition through a typical SIR pattern where they
start off as susceptible (S), are randomly selected to become infected
(I), and eventually recover (R).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
S(Susceptible) --foi--> I(Infected) --infection_period--> R(Recovered)
```

The transition is unidirectional; once recovered, individuals cannot become
susceptible again. The simulation ends when no more infection attempts or
recoveries are scheduled.

The basic structure of the model is as follows:

* A `Population Loader` that initializes a population and attaches an infection
  status property to each individual
* A `Transmission Manager` that attempts infections, updates the infections status when successful, and schedules the next attempt
* An `Infection Manager` that listens for infections and schedules recoveries
* A `Report Writer` module that listens for infections and recoveries and writes output to csv
 files.

 Note this will require some kind of parameter loading utility
from `ixa` that reads from a config file or command line arguments,
and exposes values to modules as global properties.

### People and person properties
When the `Population Loader` module initializes, a number of
persons are created and given a unique person id (from `0` to `population_size`).
This functionality is provided by an `create_person` method from `ixa`, which adds
them to a `People` data container.

In order to record the infection status of a person, we use another `ixa` utility
for defining "person properties". Internally, this associates each person in
the `People` data container with an enum value and and provides an API for modules
to read it, change it, or subscribe to events
when the property is changed somewhere else in the system.

```rust
InfectionStatus = enum(
    Susceptible,
    Infected,
    Recovered
);

for (person_id in 0..parameters.get_parameter(population_size)) {
    context.create_person(person_id = person_id)
}

context.define_person_property(
    infection_status,
    default = Susceptible
);
```

When initialized, each person is assigned a default state (`Susceptible`).

Once the population has been created, all modules have been initialized, and event listeners have been registered (more on this below), the simulation is ready
to begin the execution loop.

### Scheduling infections and recoveries
In this model, the `Transmission Manager` module begins the simulation by adding an
infection attempt `plan`, which is just a callback scheduled to execute at
`current_time = 0`. The callback randomly selects a person and transitions
them to infected if they are susceptible; if they are not susceptible,
it will skip over them. Finally, a new infection attempt is scheduled for
 a time drawn from an exponential distribution with mean value of
 `1/foi`.

```rust
fn attempt_infection(context) {
    transmission_rng = rng.get_rng(id = transmission);
    population = context.get_population();
    person_to_infect = transmission_rng.sample_int(from = 0, to = population);

    if (context.get_infection_status(person_to_infect) == Susceptible) {
        context.set_infection_status(person_to_infect, Infected);
    }

    foi = parameters.get_parameter(foi);
    time_next_infection = transmission_rng.draw_exponential(foi) / population;
    context.add_plan(attempt_infection(context), time = context.get_time() + time_next_infection);
}

//initialization
init(context) {
    context.add_rng(id = transmission);
    context.add_plan(attempt_infection(context), time = 0);
}
```

Note that this makes use of the following `ixa` functionality:

* The getters/setters provided by `person_properties`, as described in the previous
  section
* An `add_plan` method to register infection attempt callbacks
* A `random` module to sample the population and generate the next infection time

Updating the `infection_status` of a person should broadcast a mutation
event through the system, which might be structured something like the following:

![Event diagram](events.png)

For any person property that is registered, `ixa` stores a list of callbacks
registered by other modules. When that person property is mutated,
the event manager releases an event with relevant related data
(the id of the person, the old and/or new property) to all matching
callbacks.

In this model, when the `disease_status` is updated to `Infected`, a handler
registered by the `Infection Manager` will be triggered, which is responsible
for scheduling recovery plans:

```rust
fn handler(context, person_id, previous_infection_status) {
    if (context.get_infection_status(person_id) == Infected) {
        infection_rng = context.get_rng(id = infection);
        infection_period = parameters.get_parameter(infection_period)
        recovery_time = infection_rng.draw_exponential(1/infection_period);
    context.add_plan(context.set_infection_status(person_id, Recovered), time = recovery_time);
    }
}

//initialization
init(context) {
    context.add_rng(id = infection);
    context.observe_person_property_event::<DiseaseStatus>(handler);
}
```

Recovery of an infected individuals are scheduled for a time `t + infection_period`
where `infection_period` comes from an exponential distribution. A `rng` instance provides one independent from the one in the `Transmission Manager`.

### Reports

This model includes two types of reports focused on tracking the state of the
infection status:

1. Instantaneous report on changes in person properties, and
2. The current state of person properties reported periodically.

#### Instantaneous Reports
For this report, we want to record a timestamp when a person is infected
and when they recover. The output of the report will look something like this:

```
person_id,infection_status,t
0,Infected,0
1,Infected,1.2
0,Recovered,7.2
1,Infected,8.5
...
```
At initialization, a `Report` module registers a type for `Incidence`
and subscribes change events on the `infection_status` of a person

```rust
struct IncidenceReport {
    person_id: u64,
    infection_status: InfectionStatus,
    t: u64
}

fn init(context) {
    context.add_report::<IncidenceReport>("incidence");
    context.observe_person_property_event::<InfectionStatus>(handle_infection_status_change);
}
```

The method `handle_infection_status_change` writes a new line to the report file, the status, and the current time:

```rust
fn handle_infection_status_change(context, person_id, prev, current) {
    context.add_report(Incidence(
        person_id,
        infection_status: current,
        t: context.get_current_time()
    ));
}
```

One consideration here is that if the callback references context, it should
provide the state of the context exactly at the time the event was released.

#### Periodic Reports
The second type of report records something about the current state of the
simulation at the end of a period, such as after every day.

For this example, we record a count of the number of individuals with each
infection status (S,I,R) at the end of every day:

```
day,infection_status,count
0,Suceptible,92
0,Infected,8
0,Recovered,0
1,Suceptible,89,
1,Infected,12
1,Recovered,0
...
```

In this case, we could actually compute each daily summary in
post-processing from the instantaneous reports instead of generating a second
set of periodic reports. However, we want a summary of properties
which are not otherwise recorded, such as perhaps whether an individual is
hospitalized.

To efficiently keep track of the current state of each infection status,
we will create an additional data structure to keep a count of individuals in
each state and is updated every time a change event is released.

```rust
// Internally, HashMap<InfectionStatus, usize>
let counter = PersonPropertyCounter<InfectionStatus>::new();
context.add_data_container(counter);
```

On initialization, the Report manager computes an initial count for each status.
In `update_property_counter` the event handler, the counter increments/decrements
the appropriate status. It also registers a hook that execute after all plans
for a time t have executed, i.e., `on_period_end`

```rust
fn init(context){
    // Calculate the initial state
    population = parameters::get_parameter(population);
    for i in 0..population {
        counter::increment(
            counter.get_person_property_value(i)
        );
    }
    context::observe_person_property_event(update_property_counter);
    context::on_period_end(0, report_periodic_item);
}
```
Methods are implemented for the person property counter to increment and decrement
the counters. Changes in the person properties are
observed and the callback function `update_property_counter` updates the
counts for each property:

```rust
fn handle_infection_status_change(context, person_id, prev, current) {
    counter::increment(current);
    counter::decrement(prev);
}
```

When all plans have executed for a given time t, `ixa` calls the on_period_end
callback to write the report row and schedule the next periodic report:

```rust
fn report_periodic_item(t, context) {
    // Add a row for each status
    for infection_status in counter::iter() {
        context.add_report(Period(
            t,
            infection_status,
            count: counter::get_count(infection_status)
        ));
    }

    // Schedule next report
    next_report_time = context::get_time() + parameters::get_parameter(reporting_period);
    if next_report_time < parameters::get_parameter(max_time) {
        context::on_period_end(report_periodic_item, report_periodic_item);
    }
}
```

## Ixa dependencies

The following are a summary of assumed dependencies from `ixa`:

* `parameters` component: Loads parameters from a file or command line args,
   loads them into global properties (below)
* `global_properties` component: Defines properties which can be accessible
   to any module
* `person` component: Creates a `People` data container which unique ID for each person,
   provides an `add_person()` method
* `person_properties` component: connects each person ID defined by the `person`
   component with a specific property (e.g., `infection_status`), provides add/change/subscribe API
* `reports` component: Handles file writing, provides api for writing typed rows
* `random_number_generator` component: Provides seedable rng api to sample over
   a distribution, list of person ids
* `event_manager` component: provides a global send/subscribe interface
