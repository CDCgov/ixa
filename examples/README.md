# Ixa Examples

This directory contains examples that demonstrate the features,
capabilities, and common composition of models built with `ixa`.

You can run or test any example with the following commands:

```
cargo run --example {directory}
cargo test --example {directory}
```

If you're looking to get started with `ixa`, we recommend taking a look
at the code, tests, and documentation in the `basic-infection` model
example. Other examples may be in a more experimental state.

For a larger real-world example, go to the [TODO] repository.
